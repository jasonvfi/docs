# PLU Promotions

#### Overview

This is a simple-automated discount that sets a temporary price reduction (discount) for a PLU/modifier item any time that is sold between the configured start date/time and end date/time. Once the end date/time is reached, the item is again sold at its normal price.

This feature is also used for Car Wash Promotions at the POS (point-of-sale) and at the pump. For example, two dollars off a Gold Wash with the purchase of ten gallons of fuel.

#### Using PLU Promotions

Automated discounts require no special handling by the cashier. Cashier sells items like any other PLU item (scanning, Soft Key, Menu item, or entering the PLU number), and then press \[ENTER] to apply the discounts appropriately.
