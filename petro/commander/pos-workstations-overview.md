# POS Workstations Overview

Verifone Point of Sale (POS) devices typically use the Verifone Commander as the server.

The Verifone® Topaz™ XL workstation is a high-performance, reliable, point-of-sale terminal that supports peripherals such as scanners, cash drawers, PIN pads, and customer displays. The Verifone Topaz utilizes the Verifone Commander to connect to payment networks, fuel dispensers, car wash controllers, and loyalty providers. The Topaz has the ability to accept all payment options, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, coupons, and various prepaid cards.

The Verifone Topaz has a 15-inch color touchscreen display and 120-key programmable keyboard. A virtual receipt is displayed on the screen to display transactions information as items are being rung up. The configuration of the Topaz is handled through Configuration Client. The Verifone Topaz also has a built-in help menu to aid with sales transactions.

## Verifone Ruby2

Verifone Ruby2 is equipped with a 15-inch LED-backlit touch-screen interface and a multicore processor to allow fast and efficient store and customer management. Verifone Ruby2 does not have a keyboard interface which gives the site more counter space. The touch screen is made of hardened tempered glass making the screen incredibly durable. It also provides full workstation access to store operations such as price changes, store updates and software program management. The Verifone Ruby2 only works with the Verifone Commander or Verifone RubyCi Site Controllers.

## Verifone RubyCi

The Verifone RubyCi is Verifone's all in one POS and Verifone Commander solution. It combines a Verifone Ruby2 POS with the functionality of the Verifone Commander in one piece of hardware to provide fast, efficient, and complete store management. It enables users to have the ability to consolidate as well as upgrade their POS equipment with one piece of hardware.

The Verifone RubyCi can interface with additional POS terminals such as the Verifone Ruby2 or the Verifone Topaz XL to expand sales operating capabilities.
