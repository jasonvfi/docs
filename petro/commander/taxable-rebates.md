# Taxable Rebates

## Overview

Tax laws exist that require sales tax to be collected against the amount of the discount when said discount is the result of an agreement between the vendor and merchant that provides for the merchant to be reimbursed for all or part of the discounted amount. Such a scenario is termed a “rebate”.

With the “Taxable Rebate Feature”, a product can now be marketed to the consumer at the discounted price while collecting tax against the amount of the rebate. The price book/PLU file reflects the discounted price, the amount of the rebate is stored separately and the system adds the amount of the rebate to the transaction’s taxable sales total for purposes of calculating tax. Taxable rebates may be applied at the item level when a particular PLU is sold and/or at the promotional level when a particular NAXML promotion requirement is met. A single PLU may participate in multiple rebates in the same transaction regardless of whether rebates are item or promotion-based.
