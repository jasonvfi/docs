# Refunds

## Overview

Refunds and Sales are separate transaction types and cannot be combined. Refunds are subject to additional rules and restrictions; some that can be configured, some that are determined by the card processing network and some that are determined by your companyâ€™s policies and procedures.

## Using Refunds

Sales and Refunds are separate transaction types and cannot be combined. Any Refund must start by selecting REFUND.

1. Press \[REFUND] to indicate that this is a REFUND transaction
2. If prompted, key the User ID and password
3. Enter items to be refunded as appropriate
4. Press \[TOTAL] if required
5. Touch or press the method of payment (MOP)

The system does not consider the following scenarios as Refunds:

* Funds returned to customer from Prepay Underrun.
* Funds returned to customer from a sales transaction with negative line items that force the transaction total too be negative.
