# POP Discount

## Overview

The Point of Purchase (POP) Discount feature is a type of automated discount that offers fuel at a discounted price based on certain qualifying characteristics in the transaction.

Those characteristics can be the purchase of a specific PLU (perhaps, Car Wash), payment with a specific MOP (perhaps, Cash), payment with a specific card type (the site’s own payment card type), purchase of a minimum amount from a department (perhaps, Premium Fuel) or membership in the site’s loyalty program.

This broad variety of options is provided to offer flexibility. Running more than two types of POP promotions at the same time can be confusing for the clerks and for the customers and is not recommended.

:::note Fuel Discounts cannot be more than $ 0.99. Multiple POP PPG Discounts are allowed in a single transaction. The POS stacks a maximum of three POP categories, one from each category:

* Merchandise Based: PLUs (#), Minimum purchase amount ($), or Min Dept Amount ($ or #)
* Payment Based: MOP or Card Type
* Membership/Code Based :::

:::note Refer to the POP Discount feature reference documentation for information on this feature. The Feature Reference is available on Premier Portal. :::
