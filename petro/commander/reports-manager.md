# Reports Manager

## Overview

Reports are based on a period such as a shift, a day, a month, or a year in which sales are made. These reports show sales on a system-wide basis while Cashier reports apply only to a single cashier on a single register.

## Using Reports Menu

Navigate to CSR Func > Reporting Menu from the POS (While in Sales, CSR Func can be located on the right-hand side bottom corner of the screen on Topaz and bottom of the screen on Ruby2) to access the following Reporting functions:

* Cashier Worksheet
* Close Cashier Report
* Print Cashier Report
* Payroll Reports
* Other Reports

Key points to remember:

* Closing a report does not automatically print the report. The Print Report functions print the reports.
* Cashier Close affects only that register
* A Period Close, closes all registers for inside and outside sales
* Closing a period closes that period as well as any lower level periods. For e.g. “Close Day” function automatically runs a “Close Shift”
* Flash Reports provide current information for Period 1 (Shift) without closing
