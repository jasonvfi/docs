# Pay In / Pay Out

## Overview

The system uses sales, refund, safe drop, and safe loan information to keep track of how much cash should be in the cash drawer. The Pay In and Pay Out functions are used to log changes to the drawer not associated with these functions.

The Pay In function logs cash added to your drawer that is not associated with either sales or the "Safe Loan‚Äù function.

The Pay Out function logs cash taken from the drawer that is not associated with sales, refunds, or "Safe Drop" functions.

Some sites support the use of the Pay Out function to pay vendors using an integrated Money Order device.
