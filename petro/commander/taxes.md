# Taxes

## Overview

Taxes are determined by government entities based on the location of the retail site; each having their own unique requirements as to what it and is not taxable. Because multiple governing entities may collect tax for a specific area, multiple taxes may apply specific items within a transaction.

For each tax that applies to a given transaction the system keeps a separate subtotal of taxable sales and applies the tax at the transaction level.

## Using Taxes

In the POS, taxes for a given department or PLU item are already configured and normally require no special handling on the part of the cashier. The system may automatically treat certain taxed items as non-taxed items when items flagged as food-stamp eligible the configuration are purchased with food stamps.

## Tax Exemption

There may be circumstances when items normally taxed in a transaction should be sold as tax exempt: sales to tax exempt organizations or purchase for resale.

Each situation has its own requirements and cashiers should follow in-store policies and procedures before tax exempting any purchases.

1. Touch the line item that is to be exempted from tax
2. Touch Add Tax Exempt to exclude the line item when calculating taxability for this transaction
