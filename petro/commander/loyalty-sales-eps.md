# Loyalty Sales (EPS)

## Overview

Loyalty programs come in all shapes and sizes. They can offer on-the-spot discounts or future savings through incentives as coupons or points toward future purchases.

EPS loyalty sales allow the processing and redemption of loyalty transactions, both inside at the POS and outside at the dispenser card readers (DCR). These loyalty transactions are processed through the electronic payment system (EPS).

The EPS Loyalty Front End Processor (FEP) functionality include using the PCATS POS-Loyalty Host Specification, Price-per-unit Discounting, Transactions-level Discounting, and Item Level Discounting.
