# Dispenser Card Readers

## Overview

Dispenser Card Readers (DCRs) give customers the option of paying at the dispenser.

DCRs read the magnetic stripe of credit, debit, and similar cards, sends the information to a credit network, and controls dispensing fuel based on the networkâ€™s response.

## Dispenser Types

Although different manufacturers refer to card readers by various trade names, Verifone uses DCR (Dispenser Card Reader) as a generic term for all of them.
