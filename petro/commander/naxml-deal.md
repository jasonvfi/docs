# NAXML Deal

## Overview

Enhanced Mix/Match or NAXML Deal refers to a feature that offers automatic discounts when a certain quantity and/or combination of items are sold in the same transaction. These items may be entered via scan, PLU#, PLU key/button or may be assigned to a menu but all the items in the “deal” must exist in the PLU file (“price book”).

:::note Refer to the NAXML Deal feature reference documentation for information on this feature. The Feature Reference is available on Premier Portal. :::

## Using NAXML Deal

Enhanced Mix/Match or NAXML Deal requires no special handling on the part of the cashier. As items are added or removed from the transaction, the system automatically calculates any applicable discounts.

Handling of refunds of items involved in a NAXML deal is subject to store policies and procedures.

NAXML Deal supports both NAXML Combos and NAXML Mix/Match. Both features work from item lists but while NAXML Combos allows items from multiple lists, NAXML Mix/Match requires items from a single list. NAXML Mix/Match is also known as “package pricing”.
