## Car Wash

### Code Does Not Print

If a car wash code does not print on the receipt and the “CAR WASH CODE UNAVAILABLE” message was not displayed, check the following items: · The car wash department number is set up in the Department Setup function in Car Wash Manager mode. · The car wash item is set up in the Car Wash Key Setup function in Car Wash Manager mode.

## Fuel Sales

### Cannot Clear a Fuel Sale

If a fuel sale cannot be cleared from the POS, check the status of the pump using the \[VIEW] key. If the pump status is “HOLD,” then the sale may already be on the ticket, or it may be on another POS at the site. If the sale cannot be found and removed using standard transaction methods, call the Verifone Technical Support Center. The representative can provide a one-time password to access the Clear Pumps on Hold function in Fuel Manager mode.
