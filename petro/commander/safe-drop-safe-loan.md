# Safe Drop / Safe Loan

## Overview

The Safe Drop function is designed to track the amount and method of payment (MOP) that the cashier removes from the cash drawer and puts in the store safe. The journal records the date, time, and cashier number when the cashier accesses the Safe Drop function.

The Safe Loan function logs transfers of cash from the safe to your drawer.
