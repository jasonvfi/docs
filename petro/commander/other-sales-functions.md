## Add Tip

At present we do not have the ability to add a tip. Enhancements will be made in upcoming software releases for the "Add Tip" feature.

As a workaround, follow this process:

1. Create a TIP department.
2. When the customer comes to register to pay for a ticket, before tendering the transaction, ask if customer wishes to add a tip to the amount.
3. Add the tip amount to the transaction using the TIP department key.

This method of adding a tip to the order only allows dollar amounts and not percentages.

## Allow Food Stamps for Item

This function processes an item not configured as food stamp eligible as though it is eligible for payment with food stamps. It should be used in only accordance with store policies and procedures.

1. Press \[ALLOW FOOD STAMP]
2. Key item
3. Tender Sale with Food Stamps MOP alone or in combination with another

## MOP
