# Special Discount

## Overview

Special discounts are discounts for specific situations or customers, such as students or seniors. These discounts differ from standard discounts, because the discount is subtracted from the subtotal.

This feature applies a percentage discount to items flagged as eligible in the PLU or Department file. The clerk determines if the customer is eligible for the discount according to store policies and procedures, then applies it by selecting the \[Special Discount] MOP as the first MOP in the transaction.

As special discount eligible items are added to the transaction, the system keeps a subtotal and displays it to the left of the food stamp total in the MOP section of the ticket window with an indicator of “SD”.
