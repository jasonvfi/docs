POS Workstations Overview
Verifone Point of Sale (POS) devices typically use the Verifone Commander as the
server.
Verifone Topaz
The Verifone® Topaz™ XL workstation is a high-performance, reliable, point-of-sale
terminal that supports peripherals such as scanners, cash drawers, PIN pads, and
customer displays. The Verifone Topaz utilizes the Verifone Commander to connect to
payment networks, fuel dispensers, car wash controllers, and loyalty providers. The
Topaz has the ability to accept all payment options, including cash, checks, credit
and debit cards, coupons, and various prepaid cards.
The Verifone Topaz has a 15-inch color touchscreen display and 120-key
programmable keyboard. A virtual receipt is displayed on the screen to display
transactions information as items are being rung up. The configuration of the Topaz is
handled through Configuration Client. The Verifone Topaz also has a built-in help
menu to aid with sales transactions.
Verifone Ruby2

![Image](image_33_5.png)

Verifone Commander User Reference
Verifone Ruby2 is equipped with a 15-inch LED-backlit touch-screen interface and a
multicore processor to allow fast and efficient store and customer management.
Verifone Ruby2 does not have a keyboard interface which gives the site more counter
space. The touch screen is made of hardened tempered glass making the screen
incredibly durable. It also provides full workstation access to store operations such as
price changes, store updates and software program management. The Verifone Ruby2
only works with the Verifone Commander or Verifone RubyCi Site Controllers.
Verifone RubyCi
The Verifone RubyCi is Verifone’s all in one POS and Verifone Commander solution. It
combines a Verifone Ruby2 POS with the functionality of the Verifone Commander in
one piece of hardware to provide fast, efficient, and complete store management. It
enables users to have the ability to consolidate as well as upgrade their POS
equipment with one piece of hardware.
The Verifone RubyCi can interface with additional POS terminals such as the Verifone
Ruby2 or the Verifone Topaz XL to expand sales operating capabilities.
Verifone C18

![Image](image_34_7.png)

Verifone Commander User Reference
Verifone C18 is Verifone’s most powerful, integrated POS for convenience stores with
unsurpassed functionality and versatility. Verifone C18’s user interface is made for
cashiers serving customers who want a frictionless experience. The brilliant, high
definition screen is easy on the eyes. At an impressive 18.5 inches, there is abundant
real estate for all sales needs.
App Selector
The Verifone C18 POS screen can be positioned to Home (Cashier facing) or Flip
(Customer facing) and can be orientated to render applications in landscape or
portrait orientations at Home and Flip positions.
This hardware capability facilitates running multiple cashier and customer facing
applications in portrait and landscape orientations.
Note: Refer to the App Selector User Reference documentation for more
information on this feature. The User Reference is available on the Premier
Portal.

Verifone Commander User Reference
Verifone Commander
The Verifone Commander™ is a high-powered server that increases the capacity and
functionality of Verifone’s ethernet capable Point of Sale (POS) workstations by
extending the processing and communications bandwidth for managing peripherals.
Future needs are designed into the hardware to provide support for additional serial
ports and CPU boards along with additional fan and/or power connection that may be
needed as a result. Use of these expansion capabilities will be determined by
Verifone. System peripherals, such as fuel dispensers, dispenser card readers (DCRs),
and car wash controllers connect directly to the Verifone Commander.
In addition to Configuration Client, Verifone Commander also has other site
management software: Report Navigator, Transaction Manager and Verifone
Commander Console. Report Navigator is used to view reporting data for the store.
Reporting information such as the close day report can be configured to include a
multitude of report options. Transaction Manager allows for site transaction logs and
data to be accessed from the Verifone Commander or archived locally. Verifone
Commander Console enables multiple store reporting data to be consolidated into one
place for easy visibility to monitor and track sales trends.
The Verifone Commander contains a built in V950, referred to as the V950SC.
When a router is installed in this configuration, it can be configured so that the
Verifone Commander’s V950SC can:
• Receive software upgrades remotely using Verifone’s Remote Software
Download feature.

Verifone Commander User Reference
• Connect with the Verifone Helpdesk for remote troubleshooting and diagnostics.
Configuration Client
The Verifone Commander can receive configuration changes using Configuration
Client. Configuration client is a web-based utility that allows store personnel,
Verifone Authorized Service Contractors, and Verifone Helpdesk to modify site
information. To utilize Configuration Client you must be using a supported web
browser. The supported Web Browsers are:
• Chrome versions 60 or higher
• Firefox versions 53 or higher
• Internet Explorer versions 8 or higher
1. Key in the URL https://192.168.31.11/ConfigClient.html into the Web Browser
and press [Enter].
2. Enter User Name and Password.
3. Click Login.
One-Time Password (OTP) Prompt
In Base 47 and higher, there is an additional prompt for a one-time password (OTP)
implemented into Configuration Client. As part of PCI/DSS v3.2 Requirement 8.3.1,
this incorporates a multi-factor authentication for all non-console access into the
Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) for personnel with administrative access.
Menus that have this prompt include:

While the preceding is the list of functions In Base 47 that include the OTP prompt
within Configuration Client, it may be expanded to other areas and new features in
future releases.
Clicking on Guidelines to generate an OTP (see image above) will display the
3 different ways to obtain the OTP.
The OTP is 4 digits in length. When generated using any of the 3 methods above, it
will appear on the 7- Segment status display of the Verifone Commander (displaying 2
numbers at a time; the period indicates the first set of numbers). If generated from
the POS/register, it will also display on the POS screen.
6



![Image](image_38_10.png)



![Image](image_38_11.png)

Verifone Commander User Reference
The OTP is directly tied to the user’s Configuration Client login session. If the OTP is
generated and correctly entered, the OTP will be active until the user logs out or the
Configuration Client session times out for inactivity (15 minutes). The OTP does not
require re-entry after it has been saved for the session, meaning the user can go
between menus that require entry, without being prompted.
Note: The OTP requirement applies to backing up and restoring files to the
Verifone Commander using SMS Import/Export. Files that require an OTP may
not be restored to the Verifone Commander, and an error message (“One Time
Password Required”) appears when attempting to do so. Clicking OK on the
error prompt allows the rest of the import or export to proceed. Clicking
Abort aborts the remainder of the import or export. In newer versions of SMS
Import/Export, items that require OTP are removed from the backup and
restore list.

Secure User Settings
‘Secure user’ is a user who can access PA-DSS sensitive Card Holder Data (CHD)
in ‘EPS Secure Reports’ from POS via the Network Manager’ menu. POS prompts
for secure employee ID and secure user password prior to processing this menu
item.
To avoid having to type username on POS keyboard, this feature allows
associating a POS employee ID to a user. When POS prompts, secure user must
enter their ‘secure employee ID’ and the PA-DSS compliant ‘user’ password. On
successful validation, PA-DSS sensitive Card Holder Data (CHD) is exposed in the
EPS reports. If validation fails, masked PAN is provided in the EPS Reports.
Secure Admin is a ‘secure user’ who can manage ‘secure user’ as well as ‘secure
admin’ accounts.
Note: The 'Secure User Administration' section is displayed when you log in as
'manager' (the default secure user admin account) or any user that is configured
as a secure admin.
Secure User ID
Enter the Secure User ID.

Verifone C-Site Management
The Verifone C-Site Management application allows remote configuration of data
for the POS system through the web. Without visiting each location changes and
updates can be done remotely for any or all locations. These updates can be
done selectively or all at once for all the POS devices from the web application.
OTP is a one-time password generated by the Verifone Commander for accessing
certain menus. Verifone C-Site Management now supports remote generation
and retrieval of OTP. Passwords generated this way are sent to the email
address associated with the Verifone C-Site Management user login.
Note: Refer to the Verifone C-Site Management User Reference
documentation for more information on this feature. The User Reference is
available on Premier Portal.

Site Security
The POS Pairing process establishes a trust relationship between the Verifone
Commander and each Verifone POS Workstation and creates secure communication
links. It is similar to where a cellphone is paired to a speaker or automobile dash
display.
The POS workstation pairing process is strongly recommended by Verifone to be
performed on the same day the system is Auto Upgraded. After an auto upgrade, each
Verifone POS displays messages that the system needs to be paired.
Note: Refer to the POS Pairing Feature Reference documentation for more
information on this feature. The User Reference is available on Premier Portal.
Pairing after the initial Auto Upgrade, Pairing Expired/Revoked
If the POS displays the “Sec. Alert - Pairing Invalid” or the “Sec. Alert - Pairing
Required” message, follow these steps to pair the Verifone POS Workstation with the
Verifone Commander. The POS Workstation displays one of the two messages below at
login to Sales or between each transaction in Sales.

Security Log Server
Syslog is a way for network devices to send event messages to a logging server –
usually known as a Syslog server. The Syslog protocol is supported by a wide range of
devices and can be used to log different types of events. For example, a router might
send messages about users logging on to console sessions or a web-server might log
access-denied events.
This form is used to report security and OS related events to the configured server.
Enter the log server’s IP address in this form.

Verifone Commander User Reference
The objective of having all Petro PIN pads on VHQ is the ability to remediate and
resolve issues found in the field faster.
Note: Refer to the VHQ User Reference documentation for more information on
this feature. The User Reference is available on Premier Portal.
POS sends following VHQ data to EPS:
• Enable/Disable (VHQ)
• VHQ Address
• Customer ID
• Store ID
• Lane ID
• Service ID
• Customer Profile
• Pinpad ID
Enable/Disable VHQ, Customer ID and VHQ Address is configured through VHQ
Configuration form.
EPS sends the same information to PIN pad as part of the diagnostic message when the
POS logs in. VHQ extracts the information from PIN pad.
Inorder to view and update VHQ Configuration, new user role functions should be
created to view and update “VHQ Configuration”.
• vvhqconfiguration – View VHQ Configuration
• uvhqconfiguration – Update VHQ configuration
A person having the role “manager” have these (view and update) functions enabled
by default. All other roles have view function enabled by default.
Refer to Configure Roles for more information to configure roles.

Verifone Commander User Reference
After you enable VHQ, the form allows you to edit Customer ID and VHQ address.
On save, the form validates customer ID and VHQ address. VHQ address can be a URL
or an IP address. Customer ID can be Alphanumerical characters up to 64 characters.
If validation is not successful, an error message is displayed.
Service and Maintenance (SAM)
Beginning with ViperPAY version 4.06.xx, an additional Service and Maintenance (SAM)
feature will be available for Mx9xx Series PIN pads. The objective of having all Petro
PIN pads connected with the Service and Maintenance feature is the ability to
remediate and resolve issues found in the field faster. The SAM feature is included as
part of ASM entitlement for Verifone Commander locations and includes improved
Verifone Helpdesk support functions, such as:
• Review general configuration of the device, including network and system
configuration.
• Review PIN pad diagnostic logs.
66

![Image](image_98_74.png)

Verifone Commander User Reference
• Correct some operating system and application issues.
• Perform diagnostics remotely on the PIN pad, such as screen calibrations.
The SAM feature can be enabled after each PIN pad has the ViperPAY application
loaded/upgraded. Enablement is performed by selecting "Accept" on the Terms &
Conditions prompt that appears after the PIN pad application is loaded/upgraded. The
SAM feature is PIN pad specific, therefore the prompt will appear on all PIN pads once
the application is loaded/upgraded.
Rejecting the Terms & Conditions will disable SAM functionality. Verifone strongly
encourages our customers to enable the Service and Maintenance feature.
Should a customer reject the agreement after updating the ViperPAY version and
want the Service and Maintenance feature later, they can enter into System Mode on
the PIN pad, navigate to “Enable VHQ default” and change the value to 1. They will
then need to run the application from the PIN pad home screen and accept the Terms
& Conditions prompt. This must be completed for each PIN pad.
Note: The above process is same when user changes from SAM to No SAM on PIN pad.
Note: Some PIN pads have Accept and Reject soft keys. Use these keys for SAM
enablement.
Note: SAM is only available for PIN pads that are not a part of a client managed
instance of VHQ.

Fiscal Receipt
This feature is available for LAC countries. In many LAC countries, controlled receipts
(e.g. “Facturas”) are printed from the POS. The receipts typically include a controlled
sequence number and other POS controlled data.
After all MOPs are processed, the application would determine which of the five types
of receipts to print.
The five types of receipts are:
• Fiscal Sale
• Fiscal Refund
• Fuel Voucher
• Non-Fiscal Network
• Pump Test
Transaction Processing of MOPs to Generate Receipts
Pump Test
If Pump Test MOP is used, the transaction generates a Pump Test Receipt. This will
not require any data input.
Fuel Voucher
If Fuel Voucher MOP (with fuel voucher MOP code) is used, the transaction
generates a Fuel Voucher Receipt. The Fuel Voucher MOP can be used only with
Postpay Fuel and Manual Fuel line items.
When this MOP is used, no split tender, no change and no refunds are allowed.
This MOP requires 2 cashier prompts:
a) For Fuel Voucher number (Alphanumeric 0-15 chars): “Enter [receipt type name]

b) For Customer number (Alphanumeric 0-15 chars): “Enter Customer Number:“
Note: More than one post pay fuel line can be allowed.
Non-Fiscal Network
If a Network MOP is used and the FEP returns the flag “FiscalReceipt” = FALSE, the
application generates a Non-Fiscal Network Receipt.
Fiscal Refund
For a Fiscal Refund receipt, the system prompts for the original Fiscal Sale receipt
number.
Fiscal Sale
If the transaction is none of the four previous receipt types, the system generates a
Fiscal Sale Receipt.

small.
To fix this issue the new option called "Graphic Enhancer" is

three levels: LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH. The "LOW" option is the
default. "MEDIUM" and "HIGH" is used to increase the font size.

4. Local UDP port connations are to use: the fully qualified IP address and the
multicast address. For example, 230.0.0.1:14001
5. Number of upstream hops allowed for multicast packet: The DVR “Multicast”
uses the “Multicast UDP Datagram” broadcasting mechanism to send DVR event
info. According to the IETF standard regarding “Multicast UDP Datagram”, the
default ‘hop’ (or Time-To-Live - TTL) is ‘1’. The TTL value is used by routers
that when they receive a datagram, they decrement the TTL value. If the TTL
is still is greater than ‘0’, the datagram is forwarded to the router’s upstream
LAN port (WAN). The IETF cautions about using a TTL value grater than 1 for
multicast UDP datagram in that they do not want the Internet flooded with
these multicast datagrams and only allows use of the TTL value greater than 1
if the routers are kept within an internal network.

done through the Configuration Client.
Events that can be monitored are of two types:
• Real Time Events: A Real Time Event triggers notification to the remote server
only when there is an occurrence of a specific activity at the site.
• Scheduled Events: Unlike Real Time Events, Scheduled Events trigger
notification to the remote server periodically. We can configure the desired
frequency rate at which the remote server should receive notifications.

Auto Upgrade and VRSD
Overview
The Auto Upgrade feature allows a site to initiate a complete software upgrade
without requiring the presence or expertise of a technician (VASC) or intervention
from the Verifone HelpDesk.
The software is transferred to the system either by using the Auto\_Upgrade.jar
program or by an automated remote software download. Verifone Remote Software
Download (VRSD) is the name for Verifone's implementation of the automated remote
software download.
Note: Refer to the Auto Upgrade feature reference documentation for
information on this feature. The Feature Reference is available on Premier
Portal.

Car Wash
Overview
Car Wash feature is used to buy a Car Wash by different methods, at the POS, at the
dispenser or at the car wash controller (if the site has the option available). When a
customer purchases a car wash the system that is used for the purchase is forced to
print a receipt because it prints the Car Wash code on the receipt. Car Wash code is
entered at the Car Wash Controller when the customer decides to redeem the code
for the Car Wash.
When Car Wash is integrated with Verifone Commander™ Verifone Commander the
following is some information on how this works:
• Car Wash “items” must be sold as PLUs.
• Car Wash items can be sold at POS or at dispenser where consumer is led
through the required steps for purchase.
• Car Wash code (for redeeming the car wash) prints on the receipt and so ticket
printing is forced.
• The PLU Promotions feature may be used to automatically discount Car Wash
when the configured requirements for fuel purchased in the same transaction
are met.
Using Car Wash
Transactions with Car Wash purchases print the Car Wash code on the receipt
and so will always force a ticket print.
Car Wash sales may be configured to offer a promotional price based on
characteristics of the transaction.
Note: This is an example of an automated discount and requires no special
handling by the cashier.
A Car Wash sale is a PLU sale and can be sold at the POS by the following
methods:
• The PLU number
• A PLU soft key set up with a Car Wash PLU
205

Verifone Commander User Reference
• A menu key set up with Car Wash PLUs
Note: A Car wash cannot be sold as a department sale. Car wash items can also
be sold through a dispenser card reader.
Car Wash Sale at the Dispenser
Prompts for the customer to purchase one (or not) and to select a type appear
before or after the customer begins fueling, depending on the POS settings. The
following exceptions may occur:
• Car Wash Disabled: The DCRs do not display the car wash prompt.
• Cash Acceptor Sales: With cash acceptors, the car wash prompt is
always displayed before fueling.
• POS/Car Wash Controller Not Communicating: The DCRs display the
prompt "CAR WASH UNAVAILABLE".
The steps involved to sell or decline a sale of a car wash are as follows:
Note: The steps indicated depends on the type of fuel dispenser, the POS
settings, and the type of DCR. A receipt always prints if a customer purchases a
car wash at the DCR.
1. The car wash sale prompt appears if it is set for the beginning of the
sale, otherwise, go to step 2
 Touch [YES] to buy a car wash and choose from a list of wash
options
 Touch [NO] to refuse a car wash
2. The car wash sale prompt appears if set to display at the end of the sale
and the customer has not already purchased a car wash.
Note: If the site has cash acceptors the car wash prompt will be at the
beginning of the sale. Otherwise go to step 4.
 Touch [YES] to buy a car wash and then choose from a list of
wash options
 Touch [NO] to refuse a car wash
3. The DCR processes the receipt
206

Verifone Commander User Reference
 If the customer purchased a car wash, a receipt prints
 If no car wash is purchased, standard receipt procedures occur
Car Wash Sale at the POS
Car wash items are sold in the same way as any other PLU at the POS.
1. Enter Car Wash sale using one of the methods defined in “Using PLU
Sales” section
2. Press [TOTAL] to see amount due with car wash discount (if any) applied
Note: If the car wash is not working at the time the customer made the
purchase you will see one of the following messages appear on the screen:
 “CAR WASH DOWN. CODE AVAILABLE PROCEED WITH SALE?”,
answer “Y” if customer wants a rain check with car wash code or
“N” if customer decides not to purchase the car wash.
 “CAR WASH DOWN. CODE UNAVAILABLE PROCEED WITH SALE?”,
answer “Y” if the customer wants to proceed with the sale and
willing to return to get a code at a later date or “N” if customer
decides against the car wash purchase.
3. The POS processes the receipt
 If the customer purchased a car wash, a receipt prints
 If no car wash is purchased, standard receipt procedures occur
Car Wash Receipt
When a car wash is entered into a transaction, the POS prints a car wash code
on the receipt. The customer can then use this code to run the car wash. When
more than one car wash is sold on a ticket, a code prints for each one. Because
each car wash sold must have a code to go with it, enter each car wash sale
separately. The [QTY] key cannot be used.

Display show the running total with the undiscounted price for the car wash.
If the discount is set for the same price as the car wash item and the purchase
requirements are met, then the car wash is free. The customer must request the car
wash and the cashier must enter it into the transaction. The car wash promotion
prints on the receipt and on the journal.
Whether or not a car wash discount is available depends on three conditions:

Cash/Credit Pricing
Overview
Cash/Credit Pricing is used to allow a site to sell fuel at different fuel price levels
based on whether the sale is paid by Cash or Credit (e.g. sites will often set the credit
fuel price higher than the cash fuel price to offset the credit transactions fees for the
site).
If the site is using different fuel prices for cash and credit, they must disable (or
uncheck) the Ignore MOP Conflict setting in Fuel Configuration > Site Params.
The price level for each card type can be configured in the Payment Controller > EPS
Configuration >  FEPCard - Cash Credit Pricing by Card Type
configuration screen.
If no configuration is done for the price level by card type, debit and prepaid cards
default to cash fuel price level and all other card types default to credit fuel price
level.
Using Cash/Credit Pricing
Prepay Transactions
Amount Prepay: If the transaction is tendered by cash, the customer dispenses
fuel at the cash fuel price level at the pump. If the transaction is paid by
credit, the customer dispenses fuel at the fuel price level configured for the
card type (e.g. debit cards can either be configured at cash or credit price
level).
Volume Prepay: For volume prepays, the cashier must select a fuel grade and a
fuel price level when they ring up the fuel prepay. If the transaction is tendered
by cash, the MOP entered must match the fuel price level selected by the
cashier. If the transaction is paid by credit, the price level configured for the
card type must match the fuel price level selected by the cashier. If there is a
price level conflict, then an error message appears indicating "MOP Conflict".
Postpay Transactions
When the Ignore MOP Conflict parameter is enabled (or checked), sales can be
tendered using any MOP regardless of the original fuel price level of the sale.
When this parameter is not enabled (or not checked) and if the transaction is
tendered by cash, the MOP entered must match the fuel price level. If the
transaction is paid by credit, the price level configured for the card type must
218

Verifone Commander User Reference
match the fuel price level. If there is a price level conflict then an error
message appears indicating "MOP Conflict".
DCR Transactions
Transactions initiated at the dispenser card reader are authorized at the fuel
price level that has been configured for the card type that is used.
Configuring Cash/Credit Pricing
If the site is using different fuel prices for cash and credit, disable (or uncheck) the
Ignore MOP Conflict setting in Forecourt > Fuel > Site Parameters.
Configure cash and credit price amount for each fuel product service levels in
Forecourt > Fuel Prices form.

• Sites can be configured to take fuel prices with either two or three decimal
places; $xx.xx or $x.xxx. Sites cannot have mixed decimal positions while
using a single Verifone Commander.
• At two decimal sites, prices that have 3 decimal places (eg. $4.299) will only
be calculated at the 2 decimal amount (eg. $4.29).
• By default, sites are configured for 3 decimal places in $x.xxx format.
222

![Image](image_254_251.png)

Verifone Commander User Reference
Troubleshooting
If the site is using Cash/Credit pricing and did not ensure the Ignore MOP Conflict
parameter is disabled (or unchecked), customers are able to select cash price level at
the pump and pay with credit MOP for postpay transactions. This would result in the
customer receiving the lower cash price even though they are paying by credit.

Combined Discounts
Overview
Discounts can be applied in varying ways to the transaction and are distinguished at
the following levels:
 Price Per Gallon (PPG) Discounts: These discounts reduce the price of fuel at
the dispenser prior to fueling.
 Line Item Discounts: These discounts are amount discounts that apply against
an individual line item for a transaction.
 Ticket Level Discounts: These discounts are amount discounts that apply to
the entire transaction.
Discounts Categories
 Local: Local discounts are configured and applied on the POS system.
 Host: Host discounts are applied by the loyalty or payment host.
Local Discounts
POP Discount (PPG and Fuel Line Item): Only one POP discount allowed per
transaction.
VIP NAXML Discounts (Line Item): Multiple VIP NAXML discounts may be applied per
transaction.
Car Wash Promotions (Carwash Line Item): Only one Car Wash promotion allowed
per transaction.
Special Discount (MOP Ticket Level): Only one Special discount allowed per
transaction.
Manual Discount (Line Item): Multiple Manual discounts may be applied per
transaction.
Host Discounts
EPS Loyalty Discount (PPG, Ticket Level, and Line Item): Multiple EPS Loyalty
discounts may be applied per transaction.
224

Verifone Commander User Reference
Payment Host Discounts (PPG, Ticket Level, and Line Item): Multiple Payment Host
discounts may be applied per transaction.
Using Combined Discounts
• Multiple ticket level discounts may be applied in a single transaction.
• A line Item may receive multiple discounts depending on order of the
discounts within the transaction and loyalty host response.
• Depending on configuration, multiple PPG discounts can be combined in a
single transaction as a stacked PPG. This means that the multiple PPG
discounts may be combined to a single PPG discount in fuel price. The
combined discount cannot lower the price per gallon at the dispenser to
lower than the minimum Price Per Unit (PPU) setting in Fuel
Configuration.
• When combining Payment Host and EPS Loyalty discounts, the Payment
Host discounts have a higher precedence than EPS Loyalty discounts.
Configuring Combined Discounts
For the discount to be applied, the discount feature must be enabled and configured.
Refer to the configuring section of the appropriate topic for further details.
The "EPS PPG precedes POS PPG" parameter can be found in Payment Controller >
POS configuration > POS > Loyalty. When this parameter is enabled, EPS Loyalty PPG
discounts are applied before considering any POS PPG discounts. When this parameter
is disabled, POS PPG discounts are applied before considering any EPS Loyalty PPG
discounts.

Department Sales
Overview
A department is a group of similar items. For example, a dairy department might
include items like milk, butter, eggs, and ice cream.
A department item is sold in one of the following ways:
• [Department] soft key: A specific key set up for a specific department.
• [OTHER DEPT] key: A specific key set up to accept sales to any defined
department number.
The maximum number of departments that can be configured by platform:
• Ruby Ci - 9999
• Verifone Commander – 9999
Do not use departments 9990-9999:
• 9990 - Loyalty (invisible department)
• 9991 - Loyalty (invisible department)
• 9992 – Fees (invisible in new applications)
• 9998 – Manual fuel deposit – not invisible but required to ring up a manual fuel
sale that doesn’t set the dispenser. This must not be altered or changed.
• 9999 – Fuel Deposit (invisible) this department is read only because it’s the
holding department for prepay fuel sales. It cannot be modified or changed.

Department Sale with ID Check
Departments with alcohol and tobacco products are usually set up with age
verification. Purchase of these products is the same as with other departments
with the exception of the age verification feature. The system displays a
message alerting the cashier that an ID check is required.
The system rejects further entries until the date of birth is entered. Once
entered, the system determines if the customer is old enough to purchase the
item and either adds it to the transaction or displays a message.
1. Touch or scan a product requiring ID checking
2. Do one of the following:
 Key birth date (mm/dd/yy) and touch [OK] or press [ENTER]
 Swipe the magnetic stripe on the driver's license
 Scan the 2D barcode on the driver's license
The system either adds item to transaction or displays a message that purchase
is not allowed.
Department Sale with Fractional Quantity
Department items can be sold in fractional quantity.
1. Key quantity to be sold (for example: [5] [0] = 1/2 pound)
2. Press [QTY] or enter the department item
3. Do one of the following:
 Key a PLU on the keyboard and press [ENTER]
 Touch a PLU soft key
 Scan the barcode
Department Sale with At-For Pricing
Pricing for some department items is based on purchase of a particular quantity;
for example, 3 candy bars for $ 1.00. This is known as At-For Pricing (@/
pricing).
232

Verifone Commander User Reference
Note: At-For Pricing cannot be used with items sold in fractional quantities.
1. Key quantity being sold and press [QTY]
2. Key number of items on which the price is based (for example, if the
item sells three for $1.00, then key [3])

4. Do one of the following
 Touch the department
 Press the department key
 Press [OTHER DEPT] and then touch the department in the Other

Dispenser Card Readers
Overview
Dispenser Card Readers (DCRs) give customers the option of paying at the dispenser.
DCRs read the magnetic stripe of credit, debit, and similar cards, sends the
information to a credit network, and controls dispensing fuel based on the network’s
response.
Dispenser Types
Although different manufacturers refer to card readers by various trade names,
Verifone uses DCR (Dispenser Card Reader) as a generic term for all of them.
Manufacturers Card Reader Name
Bennett Dispenser Card Terminal (DCT)
Dresser/Wayne Dispenser Card Processing Terminal (DCPT)
Gilbarco CRIND®: Card Reader IN Dispenser
Tokheim Dispenser Payment Terminal (DPT)
Using Dispenser Card Readers
Dispenser Card Reader (DCR) Card Fuel Sale
Below are some common functions that are related to DCR sales:
 Approve DCR Transaction: Some states require cashier intervention
before fueling can begin.
 View Fueling Point: A small yellow triangle indicates that the network
has returned a message or customer has requested help. In either case,
fueling position should be viewed to clear the message.
 Reprint DCR Transaction: Occasionally, customers come to the counter
to request a DCR receipt (paper ran out).
This function reprints DCR and completed prepay transaction receipts.
Touch  [VIEW], touch [Reprint DCR TRAN] and select the
transaction to print.
242

Verifone Commander User Reference
The most recent transaction is always at the top of the list and
highlighted.
During a DCR transaction, a small card icon appears in the background of the
graphic for that fueling position as shown below:
POS Icon Description
DCR Calling: Customer swipes the credit card and the card
appears on button.
DCR Approved: Image changes into a nozzle ready to dispense
fuel.
DCR Dispensing: A fuel drop to show fueling.
Idle: Fueling point returns to Idle upon completion of DCR sale.
Help: Help is requested or there is a network message that
should be viewed. View pump to clear the icon.
DCR Sales Sequence Table
The sales sequences for DCR transactions for all dispensers the POS supports are in
the tables below. These tables show how the configuration can change the customer
experience at the pump. Consider the following in all tables:
 If the POS is in the idle state, the fueling point number remains lit and the
icons are dark.
 If the POS is sending data to the DCRs, a “LOADING” message replaces the
current prompt until the transmission is complete.
 Card types cause different prompts to appear:
 Debit cards: If a customer inserts a debit card without first pressing the
[DEBIT] key, “DEBIT OR CREDIT?” appears on the display. After a card
has been identified as a debit card, the display prompts with “ENTER
PIN.”
 Fleet cards: Different Fleet cards prompt the customer for information
such as odometer reading, vehicle identification number, etc.
 Stored Value Cards: Also known as prepaid cards, these cards usually
display the balance that remains on the card.

Tave
The TAVE (Trans Amor Verifone Edition) system minimizes the
flow of unencrypted payment card data within the POS system by
performing end to end encryption. Payment card data is
encrypted by TAVE enabled card readers both at the dispenser and
inside the store. Card data is encrypted by these devices and
passed to the First Data front-end processor in encrypted form for
authorization. The First Data front-end processor decrypts the
payment card data and sends the data to the issuing bank. A token
is linked to the authorization and sent back to the Verifone POS.
The VeriFone POS stores this token and uses the token instead of
unencrypted payment card data for all subsequent processing.

enabling of ‘Six Digits Gilbarco Mode’.
Note: Prior to changing the ‘PPU Decimal Position’ in Verifone Commander, the
current prices need to be changed to a whole number. For example, a default price of
1.234 should be changed to 1.000. If this is not done, then the validation of fuel

Food Stamps Payment - Electronic (EBT Food Stamps, EBT Cash

customer if they are using an EBT card. When the card is read by the PIN pad and
identified by the EPS, EPS reports back to the POS the MOP type (credit, debit, EBT
food stamp, EBT cash).
Follow the instructions on PIN pad to complete the transactions.
Considerations
• EBT Cards and paper coupons can be used only to purchase food stamp eligible
items. With paper coupons, a maximum of $.99 can be given back as cash change.
Any change tendered over $1 must be in Food Stamps change.
• Items that are eligible for EBT benefits should have the Food Stamp parameter
enabled in Store Operations > PLUs or the Allow Food Stamps parameter enabled
in Store Operations > Merchandise > Departments.
• EBT Cash Benefit allows purchase of non-food stamp eligible items.
• Refer to Split Tender Transaction to know more about completing a transaction
with food stamp and non-food stamp MOPs.
• Tax is not applied to the amount paid for by food stamps. The tax amount that
prints on the receipt displays the tax amount after the tax credit has been
deducted. The tax credit amount the customer did not have to pay also prints on
the receipt.
327

Verifone Commander User Reference
• If food stamps are tendered for less than the eligible amount and the food-stamp
items are taxable, a “Tax Credit” appears on the receipt. The credit is the
difference between the total tax due on the items and the tax charged on the
taxable items not paid for with food stamps. For example, if an amount of $16.17
is qualified for payment with food stamps, of which 10.55 is taxable at a tax rate
of 7%, then $0.74 tax is due on the $10.55. If the customer tenders $10.00 in food
stamps leaving a balance of $6.17, of which $0.55 is taxable. The Tax Credit is
$0.70 (7% of $10.00) and the tax the customer owes is $0.04 (7% of $0.55).
Go to Tax Report from Flash Reports to get information on Taxable Sales and Non-Tax
Sales.
From Verifone’s Site Report Navigator access the End of Day Report. This Report has
Tax Forgiven Amount section under Cash Controls and gives information on taxes that
were credited back due to EBT/Foodstamps/Non-tax Coupons.

NAXML Deal
Overview
Enhanced Mix/Match or NAXML Deal refers to a feature that offers automatic
discounts when a certain quantity and/or combination of items are sold in the same
transaction. These items may be entered via scan, PLU#, PLU key/button or may be
assigned to a menu but all the items in the “deal” must exist in the PLU file (“price
book”).
Note: Refer to the NAXML Deal feature reference documentation for
information on this feature. The Feature Reference is available on Premier
Portal.
Using NAXML Deal
Enhanced Mix/Match or NAXML Deal requires no special handling on the part of
the cashier. As items are added or removed from the transaction, the system
automatically calculates any applicable discounts.
Handling of refunds of items involved in a NAXML deal is subject to store policies
and procedures.
NAXML Deal supports both NAXML Combos and NAXML Mix/Match. Both features
work from item lists but while NAXML Combos allows items from multiple lists,
NAXML Mix/Match requires items from a single list. NAXML Mix/Match is also
known as “package pricing”.

Configuring NAXML Deal
Use Promos and Discounts > NAXML Deal to configure NAXML deal.
Deals are formed in the following ways:
• As PLU items are entered into a transaction, the system checks first for NAXML
Mix/Matches, then for NAXML Combos.
• NAXML Mix/Match qualifies promotions based on quantity of items.
• When an item qualifies in multiple NAXML Combos, the system matches up the
higher priority Combo.

Field
Allowable Value/Function
To configure promotions in a particular order of priority. The priority
setting allows certain promotions to take precedence over others that
share many of the same items. Priority of promotions is particularly
useful when programs give discounts as more items are added in
combination.
For example:
• Promo1 – Discount for soda and chips (priority = low)
Priority • Promo2 – Discount for soda, chips, and sandwich (priority =
medium)
• Promo3 – Discount for soda, chips, sandwich, and salad. (priority
= high)
Without the ability to set priority, promo 2 and 3 will never be
realized, as the soda and chips will always form Promo1.
Default setting is medium. Any promotion that does not specifically
identify the priority will be assumed “medium” by the system.

Feature Reference”. Refer to both the feature reference documents to
understand this feature.
EMV is the new standard for credit card processing. It describes a transaction between
a chip card and an EMV-enabled terminal. EMV transactions are much more secure
than magnetic-stripe-card transactions.
To run EMV transactions at a site, EMV must be enabled from the Config Client in the
EMV Configuration form, then both the Viper (EPS) and the PIN pads (POPs) need to
be configured with a required set of EMV configurations. Some distributions enable
EMV by default but check this setting before proceeding on to EMV configuration.
The EMV configurations include:
• Certification Authority Public Keys
• EMV Terminal Parameters
• Set of supported AIDs and their associated parameters
To process EMV chip cards, The EPS system must have all three of those
configurations. Depending on the Acquiring host and supporting software (FEP) the
configuration data may be populated using:
• A PDL download containing the necessary EMV configuration from the host
• Pre-populated data based on host specifications
• Custom table downloads from Verifone table partners
Refer to your specific FEP documentation to determine which method is used.
The EMV Feature Reference Manual also has more details on the configuration.
After the EMV configuration has been configured successfully on the EPS system, the
EPS system pushes the appropriate EMV configurations into the POPs as required.
Usually this configuration push to the POPs is transparent to the user but it is prudent
to check for any reported errors in pushing the configuration by referring to the “POP
Configuration Status” in the EMV Initialization form (Screen Shot Illustrated below).
EMV based transactions may allow stand-in processing to approve transactions even if
the online payment host is offline and not available.
EMV data in a transaction allows the system to consider many conditions when making
a decision to stand in for a transaction. The system still uses the traditional Magnetic
Swipe Read (MSR) data points, but additional EMV data allow for much finer decision
points for consideration.
367

Verifone Commander User Reference
It is important to check that the EMV Standin Parameters are correctly configured.
Each FEP has different Standin configuration. Refer to your specific FEP
documentation for FEP specific Standin values.
The system also supports manual push of the EMV configuration to specific POPs if
required. One example of when this might be required is if a POP is replaced.
Quick Chip Configuration
Note: Refer to the EMV feature reference documentation for information on this
feature. The Feature References are available on Premier Portal. There are two
feature references for EMV, “Inside EMV Feature Reference” and “Outside EMV
Feature Reference”. Refer to both the feature reference documents to
understand this feature.
An EMV Quick Chip (QC) transaction is a faster way to perform EMV transactions. In a
QC flow, the chip read, AID selection, 1st Gen AC, EMV completion and card removal
can all be done prior to the total amount is entered.
EMV Quick Chip increases payment transaction speed at the POS by changing the POS
flow. This means that merchants can begin the authorization process before obtaining
the final total amount. The consumer can also insert the payment card and key in the
PIN while cashier is still totaling items for purchase. Final total is the last piece of
data to be sent for authorization.

Proprietary Card
Proprietary Card interface is used to communicate with proprietary card hosts.
EPS Loyalty
EPS loyalty sales allow the processing and redemption of loyalty transactions, both
inside at the POS and outside at the dispenser card readers (DCR). These loyalty
transactions are processed through the electronic payment system (EPS).
Scanner
There are two types of scanners supported: Ruby Ready Scanner (1D barcodes) and 2D
Scanner (2D barcodes).
The appropriate scanner type must be configured on the POS using CSR Functions >
Maintenance > Device Configuration > Scanner Config, as the communication baud
rate settings depends on this configuration.
Note: Distributors need to preconfigure the scanner device to work with
Verifone POS systems.
Random Weight barcode support
Random weight products are typically perishable items (e.g., meat, bakery, cheese,
fish and poultry) that are sold on a price per pound basis. Most random weight
products are packaged and price-marked in the store. However, some may be
packaged, and price marked by a manufacturer before they are delivered to the
store.
390

Verifone Commander User Reference
Items are weighed, and the scale produces the barcode. Scale is configured with
PLUs, item names and prices for 1 unit (pound) of the product. The scale weighs the
items, calculates the price and creates the barcode.
Configure the POS with the same PLUs, same descriptions and prices. The parameter
Fractional Quantity should be selected in the PLU form to sell the PLUs in fractional
quantities.
The barcode is scanned, POS calculates quantity based on price (in barcode) and price
(in PLU file) to collect money from customer. The quantity gets printed on receipt
and in reports.
Using Scanners
Scanners can be used at any point during the transaction to scan items prior to
tendering the sale. Coupons can also be scanned with scanners during the
transaction. Scanners can also be used for entering drivers licenses with 2D
barcodes.
Note: See the Easy ID Feature Reference document for further information
on scanning driver license barcodes and the Coupon Scanning Feature
Reference document for further information on scanning coupons. The
Feature Reference documents are available on Support.Verifone.com >
Petro & Convenience > General Info – Feature Reference.
Configuring Scanners
The appropriate scanner type must be configured on the POS using CSR Functions >
Maintenance > Device Configuration > Scanner Config, as the communication baud
rate settings depends on this configuration.
The POS system can be configured for only one type of scanner.

PLU Promotions
Overview
This is a simple-automated discount that sets a temporary price reduction (discount)
for a PLU/modifier item any time that is sold between the configured start date/time
and end date/time. Once the end date/time is reached, the item is again sold at its
normal price.
This feature is also used for Car Wash Promotions at the POS (point-of-sale) and at the
pump. For example, two dollars off a Gold Wash with the purchase of ten gallons of
fuel.
Using PLU Promotions
Automated discounts require no special handling by the cashier. Cashier sells
items like any other PLU item (scanning, Soft Key, Menu item, or entering the
PLU number), and then press [ENTER] to apply the discounts appropriately.

PLU Sales
Overview
PLU means “Price Look Up” and a PLU sale is one whose price is defined and can be
“looked up” on the system’s price book using a numeric identifier. There are a
number of ways to enter a PLU number (scanner, menu or button assignment or
manually keyed).
When this number (which may also be a barcode) is provided to the system, the
system can locate the item’s price, taxability, reporting department and other details
associated with that number. So, all that is required to sell a PLU item is to provide
the identifying number along with the quantity of the item being sold.
Our system supports the concept of “modifiers” to provide a mechanism to more
specifically define the product when the same barcode is used to indicate different
packaging of the same product. This is seen most often on canned soda (singles, 6-
packs, etc). The combination of the PLU# and modifier uniquely identifies a product
along with its price, taxability and other information. For most PLUs, this modifier
value is zero.
Modifiers
A PLU is made up of a PLU number and a modifier number. A single PLU can have up
to 255 modified versions. Modifiers let you group similar items into the same PLU
number.
For example, you might want to group all Coke products:
Product PLU Modifier
100 0
Coke - six-pack cans
100 1
Coke - two-liter plastic
100 2
Coke - single can
100 3
Coke - 16-oz. bottle
The first PLU/modifier combination created must use modifier 0. All other modifiers
of the PLU can be any number between 1 and 255. If no modifier is entered during a
selection, the modifier is assumed to be 0.

POP Discount
Overview
The Point of Purchase (POP) Discount feature is a type of automated discount that
offers fuel at a discounted price based on certain qualifying characteristics in the
transaction.
Those characteristics can be the purchase of a specific PLU (perhaps, Car Wash),
payment with a specific MOP (perhaps, Cash), payment with a specific card type (the
site’s own payment card type), purchase of a minimum amount from a department
(perhaps, Premium Fuel) or membership in the site’s loyalty program.
This broad variety of options is provided to offer flexibility. Running more than two
types of POP promotions at the same time can be confusing for the clerks and for the
customers and is not recommended.
Note: Fuel Discounts cannot be more than $ 0.99.
Multiple POP PPG Discounts are allowed in a single transaction. The POS stacks a
maximum of three POP categories, one from each category:
• Merchandise Based: PLUs (#), Minimum purchase amount ($), or Min Dept
Amount ($ or #)
• Payment Based: MOP or Card Type
• Membership/Code Based
Note: Refer to the POP Discount feature reference documentation for
information on this feature. The Feature Reference is available on Premier

Reports Manager
Overview
Reports are based on a period such as a shift, a day, a month, or a year in which sales
are made. These reports show sales on a system-wide basis while Cashier reports
apply only to a single cashier on a single register.
Using Reports Menu
Navigate to CSR Func > Reporting Menu from the POS (While in Sales, CSR Func
can be located on the right-hand side bottom corner of the screen on Topaz and
bottom of the screen on Ruby2) to access the following Reporting functions:
• Cashier Worksheet
• Close Cashier Report
• Print Cashier Report
• Payroll Reports
• Other Reports
Key points to remember:
• Closing a report does not automatically print the report. The Print
Report functions print the reports.
• Cashier Close affects only that register
• A Period Close, closes all registers for inside and outside sales
• Closing a period closes that period as well as any lower level periods. For
e.g. “Close Day” function automatically runs a “Close Shift”
• Flash Reports provide current information for Period 1 (Shift) without
closing

• The Cashier Report calculates totals for a single cashier on a single register.
• Shift is the smallest amount of time that contains report totals for all registers
and cashiers.
• Yearly is the largest amount of time that contains report totals for all registers
and cashiers.
• The Current Cashier Report prints the current totals for cashiers without having
to close the shift.
Note: Closing a period will close all smaller periods. For example, if a Close Daily is
performed, it will also close any open cashiers, then it will close any open shifts, and
then it will close the open day.
See the example below:
The example displays a two-period system. The following period closings were done:
• Close Shift 1
• Cashiers 1 and 2 close. The cashier totals reset to 0.

Cashier Reports
Close Cashier Totals
The Close Cashier Totals function closes and resets drawer totals. A cashier’s totals
can be closed by the cashier who entered Sales mode and used the drawer, or another
employee, such as a manager, who has a higher security level than the cashier. In a
multiterminal system, the totals are closed for the cashier on the terminal where the
close is done. If a cashier has sales on more than one terminal, the cashier totals must
be closed on each terminal separately.
In Configuration Client, If the “Force Cashier Closed” setting in Report Configuration
is selected, then each open cashier is closed automatically when a Close Shift
function is run.
Note: The Cashier Report is not printed when performing the Close Cashier Totals
function. This allows the cashier whose shift is over to take the closed drawer to
another location and count it while a new cashier starts working on a new drawer.
When the cashier finishes counting their drawer, they can then use the Print Cashier
Report function and enter the totals from their Cashier Worksheet.
Print Cashier Report
The Print Cashier Report function prints any one of the last three cashier closes for a
specific cashier. A Cashier Report can be printed by the cashier who entered Sales
435

Verifone Commander User Reference
mode and ran transactions or another employee, such as a manager, who has a higher
security level than that cashier. The first time a Cashier Report prints, the POS
prompts for the amount of each method of payment. The amounts the cashier enters
are compared to the totals the terminal has calculated. If a Cashier Report prints
more than once, then the POS does not prompt for MOP amounts.
If the Cashier Report prints again after the totals have been entered, the report prints
with no questions.
Cashier Changes
The Cashier Report is not printed when the report is closed. This allows the cashier
who is leaving to close totals, remove the drawer, and go into another room to count
the drawer. The new cashier can put another drawer in and start work right away.
The cashier who is counting the closed drawer can enter the amount of each method
of payment on the Cashier Worksheet. Then, when there is a break in customer
activity, the cashier can run the Print Cashier Report function, enter the totals from
the worksheet, and print the report.
MOP File
The Method of Payment types that are prompted for when performing the Print
Cashier Report function are configured on Configuration Client > Store Operations >
Payment > MOP tab. On each MOP, selecting the “Cashier Report Prompt” setting
determines if that MOP type will prompt.
Sample Cashier Worksheet
The Print Worksheet function prints a form to record the amounts of each method of
payment when counting a closed drawer. The totals on this worksheet are then used
when performing the Print Cashier Report function.

The Summary Flash Report provides an overview of all sales from the beginning of the
current period up to the time the Flash report is printed.
In a multi-terminal system, the report includes all registers together.
If the necessary parameters are set, the site may have Autocollect Inside.
Autocollect transactions that are recalled inside on a POS do not appear in the
Autocollect Report. They appear in the fuel totals and in the credit and cash
section of that register’s Summary Report.
Note: In general, Summary Report items that have a $0.00 balance at the time
the report prints or closes, are not included in the report.

the original fuel sale. In other words, this does not increase the
number of items.
• Bottle deposits count as items.
• Bottle returns are treated as refunded items.
• #CUSTOMERS: Number of customers (individual transactions).
• If a prepay fuel sale has an underrun or is refunded due to a
reserve stop, the resulting refund is counted as the same
customer and does not increase the total number of customers.

• Grand Totalizer Difference: Calculated using the following:
+ Grand Totalizer Ending (Totalizers)
- Grand Totalizer Beginning (Totalizers)
Totalizer Handling
There are two main differences between the SALES TOTALIZER and the GRAND
TOTALIZER. The first difference involves how each is affected by different types of
transactions and item sales. The second difference is whether an amount is
subtracted from it.
The SALES TOTALIZER difference (ENDING SALES TOTALIZER minus BEGINNING SALES
TOTALIZER) reflects NET SALES plus NET TAX. Refunds, discounts and negative sales
are subtracted from it along with any applicable taxes. As a result, the Sales
Totalizer tracks more closely to actual NET SALES than does the Grand Totalizer.
The GRAND TOTALIZER difference (ENDING GRAND TOTALIZER minus BEGINNING
GRAND TOTALIZER) reflects a more complex formula and numbers are never
subtracted from it. Because of this one rule, when reconciling the GRAND TOTALIZER
to the SALES TOTALIZER (or to other NET SALES-based totals), any amount which
would have normally subtracted from the SALES TOTALIZER (refunds, discounts,
462

Verifone Commander User Reference
negative sales, etc) will vary by twice its amount when compared to the GRAND
TOTALIZER.
Sales Totalizer Grand Totalizer\*

example, if an item is refunded in the amount of $1.50, the amount added to the GT is
$1.50. Also, if a negative item sale occurs in the amount of $1.00, then the amount of $1.00
is added to the GT.

time and restricts sale of some products by age.
In a transaction, following types of restrictions can be used:
 Blue Law - Set up any local government time periods that restrict sales on
certain items during defined periods of time.
 Customer ID Check - Sale of some products is restricted by age.

Safe Drop / Safe Loan
Overview
The Safe Drop function is designed to track the amount and method of payment
(MOP) that the cashier removes from the cash drawer and puts in the store safe. The

Safe Drop function.
The Safe Loan function logs transfers of cash from the safe to your drawer.

until a Safe Drop is performed and the calculated amount in the cash
drawer of that payment type is less than the configured limit.
If more than one method of payment exceeds its configured limit, the message
for each will be displayed on a rotating basis.

Reporting
The Safe Drop Flash Report prints after each period report and lists safe drops that
occur from the time the period started up to the time the flash report prints. The
information is given two ways:
 In the order the safe drops occur
 In order by method of payment
If the period report prints at any time other than when the period is closed, the Safe
Drop flash report states “No Totals Available.” If no safe drops have been made, “NO
SAFE DROPS” prints.
Safe Drop and Safe Loan aggregate totals (count and amount by MOP) are included in
the Pay In / Pay Out sections of the Cashier and Summary Reports. Safe Drop Detail is
provided in the Safe Drop Detail Report.

Special Discount
Overview
Special discounts are discounts for specific situations or customers, such as students
or seniors. These discounts differ from standard discounts, because the discount is
subtracted from the subtotal.
This feature applies a percentage discount to items flagged as eligible in the PLU or
Department file. The clerk determines if the customer is eligible for the discount
according to store policies and procedures, then applies it by selecting the [Special
Discount] MOP as the first MOP in the transaction.
As special discount eligible items are added to the transaction, the system keeps a
subtotal and displays it to the left of the food stamp total in the MOP section of the
ticket window with an indicator of “SD”.
Note: Refer to the Special Discount feature reference documentation for
information on this feature. The Feature Reference is available on Premier
Portal.
525

Taxes
Overview
Taxes are determined by government entities based on the location of the retail site;
each having their own unique requirements as to what it and is not taxable. Because
multiple governing entities may collect tax for a specific area, multiple taxes may
apply specific items within a transaction.
For each tax that applies to a given transaction the system keeps a separate subtotal
of taxable sales and applies the tax at the transaction level.
Using Taxes
In the POS, taxes for a given department or PLU item are already configured and
normally require no special handling on the part of the cashier. The system may
automatically treat certain taxed items as non-taxed items when items flagged
as food-stamp eligible the configuration are purchased with food stamps.
Tax Exemption
There may be circumstances when items normally taxed in a transaction should
be sold as tax exempt: sales to tax exempt organizations or purchase for resale.
Each situation has its own requirements and cashiers should follow in-store
policies and procedures before tax exempting any purchases.
1. Touch the line item that is to be exempted from tax
2. Touch Add Tax Exempt to exclude the line item when calculating
taxability for this transaction

Break Point Table
Use the Break Point Table form to define tax break points for sales amounts when a
flat sales tax does not apply. The amount of tax charged depends on where in the
table the taxable amount falls.
Before setting up the Break Point Table in SMS, obtain the state, county, or local tax
table for which you want to create a break point definition. By entering data from
that table into a worksheet you can determine the following:
• The starting point.
• The tax break points and the repeating pattern.
• The limit of the tax table, if there is one.
In addition, you need to know the tax rate to apply to sales above the break point tax
limit (if there is a limit).
Example Worksheet
Following is a worksheet used to determine the information above for our example
Break Point Table. You can see that the pattern repeats every six increments.
Number Start End Difference Increment

Taxable Rebates
Overview
Tax laws exist that require sales tax to be collected against the amount of the
discount when said discount is the result of an agreement between the vendor and
merchant that provides for the merchant to be reimbursed for all or part of the
discounted amount. Such a scenario is termed a “rebate”.
With the “Taxable Rebate Feature”, a product can now be marketed to the consumer
at the discounted price while collecting tax against the amount of the rebate. The
price book/PLU file reflects the discounted price, the amount of the rebate is stored
separately and the system adds the amount of the rebate to the transaction’s taxable
sales total for purposes of calculating tax. Taxable rebates may be applied at the
item level when a particular PLU is sold and/or at the promotional level when a
particular NAXML promotion requirement is met. A single PLU may participate in
multiple rebates in the same transaction regardless of whether rebates are item or
promotion-based.
Note: In order to legally increase the tax basis of the transaction without
increasing the before-tax subtotal, use of this feature may involve additional
requirements such as on-site signage. Compliance with those additional
requirements is the responsibility of the merchant and/or enterprise.

Time Clock
Overview
Use any of the following Payroll Functions to clock in, clock out, or change job code
to log time spent performing various tasks. Job code numbers are assigned according
to company policy and procedures.
Note: Time clock functions are separate from logging into or exiting from sales.
Clock In / Out
The "Clock In / Out" function clocks an employee in and out. The Clock In / Out adds
and removes employees from the POS’ internal time clock, and this information is
used to calculate the payroll.
Notes:
• Employees cannot clock in or out without having a name assigned in
Employee File.
• Clock Out function permitted only for employees who are clocked in and
vice versa.
Change Job Code
Use "Change Job Code" function to change the job code. Job codes are used to log
time spent performing particular job tasks. Also, the job code function logs when a
new/different job task is begun.

Reporting
The Payroll Report prints either a current or close payroll report that lists the dates
and times each employee clocked in and out. If an employee is clocked in when a
report is run, that employee’s clock out date and time are listed as ‘PENDING’.
The report must be closed manually from the POS and is separate from any other
“close” function. The Payroll Report can be printed from the Site Report Navigator.
The report can be printed for a specific employee (by employee ID number) or for all
employees.
Payroll Report Highlights
• Time is reported in hours and minutes (not in hours and hundredths of hours)
on a 24-hour clock. For example, a Payroll Report for someone who clocked in
at 15:44 and clocked out at 23:59 would report Total Hours of 8:15, indicating
the employee worked 8 hours and 15 minutes.
549

• The payroll report does not reset total hours to zero.
• The close payroll report does reset total hours to zero.

Transactions
Overview
A transaction is any function that can affect the total amount in the drawer. Our
system supports several types, including:
 Sales
 Refunds
 Pay In
 Pay Out
 Safe Drop
 Safe Loan
The last four items in the above list are discussed in separate sections. Sales and
Refunds do not occur in the same transaction.
There are a few additional functions that work on a transaction by transaction basis:
 Suspend / Recall Transaction (Sales and/or Refunds only)
 Ticket Print (any completed or suspended transaction)
Using Transactions
Refund
1. Press [REFUND]
2. Enter items to be refunded, following store policies and procedures
3. Press [TOTAL] if required
4. Press [MOP]
Note: If refunding a card payment additional information may be required by
the card processor.

Reporting
All transaction types occurring within a reporting period are represented on Summary
and Cashier Reports for that period.
Sales, Refunds, Pay in and Pay Out are all represented on the Summary and Cashier
Reports with “Safe Drop” being included as a type of “Pay Out” and “Safe Loan” as a
type of “Pay In”.
Suspended Sales are represented as memo items in those same reports as shown
below:

Report Details
 SUSPENDED: Number of times and total amount of suspended transactions.
This happens when the [SUSPEND] key is used to suspend and then recall a
transaction. If a single transaction is suspended more than once, each time the
transaction is suspended adds to the total number and amount of suspends.
 SUSPEND/VOID: Number of times and total amount of suspended transactions
that were voided rather than settled.
 UNSETTLED SUSPENDS: The number and amount of transactions suspended at
the time a period is closed.
